# Cocktail_App

This is an application that makes it easier to make and gather ingredients for cocktails. 
When you want to make one drink, you dont want to have to buy a big bottle of one thing that is only for that drink. 
And what if there are other cocktails that use that same ingredient, how would you know what uses it. 
With this app you can list all the ingridients you have and it will show you what cocktails you can make with them and all the drinks that need only one more ingredient. 
Hopefully now you would be able to go out and get a handfull of ingredients that can be used in different combinations to make a hole variety of drinks.
The application has 6 things it can do.

This app was made first to be run in the terminal. But now I have started to transition it to a UI. 
This is why only two of the buttons work in the current version. These buttons are "search Cocktail" and "List of Cocktails (A-Z)".
